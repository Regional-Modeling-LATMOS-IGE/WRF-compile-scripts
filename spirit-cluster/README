#---- WRF/WRF-Chem compilation scripts for the spirit cluster at ESPRI/IPSL
#
# Louis Marelle, 2022/10/14

These compilation scripts are machine-specific and developped for spirit.

If the file system or modules on this machine are updated they might no
longer work.

These scripts can be adapted for different machines by changing the modules
and library paths, and the job management instructions (here SLURM/SBATCH
instructions) if a different queue system is used.
