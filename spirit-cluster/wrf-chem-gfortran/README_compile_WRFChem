#---- Instructions for compiling WRF-Chem4 on the spirit IPSL cluster
#
# Louis Marelle, 2022/10/04

Create a space for the WRF source code on your home
 mkdir ~/WRF
 mkdir ~/WRF/src
 mkdir ~/WRF/src/WRF-Chem-Polar

Obtain the WRF code from
https://github.com/Regional-Modeling-LATMOS-IGE/WRF-Chem-Polar. You only need
to do this one, not every time you recompile.
 cd ~/WRF/src/WRF-Chem-Polar
 git clone https://github.com/Regional-Modeling-LATMOS-IGE/WRF-Chem-Polar.git WRFV4
If you do not plan to develop the model and do not have a lot of space on your
home , you can get a lighter version of the code with --depth=1
 git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Regional-Modeling-LATMOS-IGE/WRF-Chem-Polar.git WRFV4
If you want to access the development version, ask me (Louis Marelle) for the
github adress of the development version and replace it in the instructions
above.

Clean up the code
cd ~/WRF/src/WRF-Chem-Polar/WRFV4
./clean -a

Switch to the model git branch containing polar updates
 git checkout develop_polar
Or switch to your branch of interest. You can list all our development branches with
 git branch | grep 'dev/'
Then
 git checkout <branch_name>

Copy the WRF compilation scripts from here to the WRF code folder
 cp <path_to_here>/compile*WRF*sh ~/WRF/src/WRF-Chem-Polar/WRFV4/
Compared to a WRF installation, the only difference in the compilation script
is with these switches: export WRF_CHEM=1 export WRF_KPP=1, and loading some
extra libraries.


------------- Compile WRF-Chem from scratch (clean compilation) ------------
Launch the compilation jobscript
 sbatch compile_WRFChem.sh
This script loads libraries, sets up compilation options, cleans any previous
installation files and executables in main/, and runs the compilation script in
the cluster queue

You can check the status of the compilation with
 tail -f compile.log

When the compilation is over, if everything went fine wrf.exe and real.exe
should be present in main/ and compile.log should contain this line at the end:
'  --->                  Executables successfully built                  <---'

I recommend copying wrf.exe and real.exe from main/ to
~/WRF/src/WRF-Chem-Polar/executables
so that you do not accidentally overwrite them later when recompiling and can
keep past executables for rerunning a past simulation with the exact same
version.

In order to set up and run a WRF-Chem simulation you will also need to install
WPS (see WPS compilation README)
