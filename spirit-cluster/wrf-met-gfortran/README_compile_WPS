#---- Instructions for compiling WPS4 on spirit
#
# Louis Marelle, 2022/09/30

When compiling WPS, WRF should already be compiled and available in (for
example) ~/WRF/src/WRF-Chem-Polar

Obtain the WPS code from https://github.com/wrf-model/WPS
 cd ~/WRF/src
 git clone https://github.com/wrf-model/WPS.git

Clean up the code
 cd ~/WRF/src/WPS
 ./clean -a
 ./clean -aa

Copy the WPS compilation scripts from here to the WPS code folder
 cp <path_to_here>/*WPS*sh ~/WRF/src/WPS

Set WRF_DIR, the path to WRF, for WPS compilation, for example
 export WRF_DIR=~/WRF/src/WRF-Chem-Polar/WRFV4

Launch the compilation. The script also sets up compilation options and
environment variables, and loads GNU and NetCDF libraries, compiling the model
with option gfortran compiler + dmpar (3). The exact same libraries will have
to be loaded every time a simulation is launched.
 source compile_WPS.sh

You can check the status of the compilation in file compile.log

When the compilation is over, links to the following executables will be
created at the base WPS directory.
geogrid.exe, ungrib.exe, metgrid.exe
If the executables are missing, the compilation failed, check compile.log for
more info on the error

In order to rum, WPS needs additional geographic data available at
https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_sources_wps_geog.html
The data is already available on CICLAD at /data/marelle/WRFChem/WPS_DATA/geog_wrf4
