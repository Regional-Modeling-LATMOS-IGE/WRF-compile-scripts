#---- Compilation scripts for WRF-Chem preprocessors for the spirit IPSL cluster
#
# Louis Marelle, 2022/10/14

For compilation on spirit/jean-zay clusters, a modified version of the
preprocessor code can be retrieved from my home space
cp -rf /home/marelle/WRF/src/wrfchem-preprocessors-dev ~/WRF/src/
This code cannot be rehosted publically so it is unfortunately not in the
public Regional-Modeling-LATMOS-IGE github. The original preprocessor code is
from the Atmospheric Chemistry Observations and Modeling Lab (ACOM) of NCAR,
see:
https://www.acom.ucar.edu/wrf-chem/download.shtml
https://www.acom.ucar.edu/Data/fire/

Compilation scripts should be copied in each preprocessor's source code
directory and then run, e.g. for fire_emis:
cp compile_fire_emis.sh ~/WRF/src/wrfchem-preprocessors-dev/fire_emis/
cd ~/WRF/src/wrfchem-preprocessors-dev/fire_emis/
./compile_fire_emis.sh


The preprocessors that need to be compiled are:
- mozbc
  Preprocessor for chemical/aerosol initial and boundary conditions,
  interpolating global model fields from MOZART4 or CAM-Chem to the WRF-Chem
  grid
- megan_bio_emiss
  Preprocessor for MEGAN bio emissions in WRF-Chem, used between 2 calls of
  real.exe to include additional vegetation data in  wrfinput files 
- wes-coldens
  Preprocessor for setting up parameters for photolysis (exo_coldens) and dry
  deposition (wesely) for MOZART gas-phase mechanisms in WRF-Chem
- fire_emis
  Preprocessor for creating wrffirechemi fire emission input files for WRF-Chem
  from FINN emissions
