#---- Compilation scripts for WRF-Chem preprocessors for the spirit IPSL cluster
#
# Louis Marelle, 2022/10/14

Compilation scripts should be copied in each preprocessor's source code
directory and then run with e.g.:
./compile_fire_emis.sh

For compilation on spirit/jean-zay clusters, a modified version of the
processor code need to be downloaded from the Regional-Modeling-LATMOS-IGE
github

The original preprocessor code is from the Atmospheric Chemistry Observations
and Modeling Lab (ACOM) of NCAR, see:

- mozbc
  Preprocessor for chemical/aerosol initial and boundary conditions,
  interpolating global model fields from MOZART4 or CAM-Chem to the WRF-Chem
  grid
- megan_bio_emiss
  Preprocessor for MEGAN bio emissions in WRF-Chem, used between 2 calls of
  real.exe to include additional vegetation data in  wrfinput files 
- wes-coldens
  Preprocessor for setting up parameters for photolysis (exo_coldens) and dry
  deposition (wesely) for MOZART gas-phase mechanisms in WRF-Chem
- fire_emis
  Preprocessor for creating wrffirechemi fire emission input files for WRF-Chem
  from FINN emissions
