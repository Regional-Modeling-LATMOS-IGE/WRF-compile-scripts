#---- WRF/WRF-Chem compilation scripts
#
# Louis Marelle, 2022/10/14

These compilation scripts are machine-specific.
jeanzay-cluster/ - Scripts for the jean-zay cluster at IDRIS
spirit-cluster/ - Scripts for the spirit cluster at ESPRI/IPSL

If the file system or modules on these machines are updated they might no
longer work.

These scripts can be adapted for different machines by changing the modules
and library paths, and the job management instructions if a different queue
system is used.
